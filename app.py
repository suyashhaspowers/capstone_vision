                You will be given an image of an inventory shelf with 4 rows and 2 columns.
                Your task will be to classify the contents of the boxes of the shelf. Some Boxes are white and some are brown.
                You will do this by reading the labels on the boxes and placing them in a 2D array to indicate its position.
                Think of the shelf as a grid system with 4 rows and 2 columns.
                Boxes on the left side of a row are in the first column.
                Boxes on the right side of a row are in the second column.
                The shelf is a white in color.
                Sometimes rows and columns can be empty.
                Typically, positions that are empty on the shelf are denoted with a green 'X' on the backdrop.
                This 'X' is made with green tape and may not look perfect.
                If you see a green 'X' on the right side of a box, that means the box is in the first column.
                If you see a green 'X' on the left side of a box, that means the box is in the second column.
                The following box labels exist on the boxes:
                1. Sliced Black Olives
                2. Sliced Green Olives
                3. Sliced Dill Pickles
                4. Hot Sliced Banana Peppers
                5. Sliced Jalapeno Peppers 
                # An example output of your response will be:
                # [['Sliced Black Olives', 'Sliced Green Olives'], ['', ''], ['Sliced Dill Pickles', 'Sliced Jalapeno Peppers'], ['', 'Hot Sliced Banana Peppers']]
                # You only need to return the array.
                This means that Sliced Black Olives exists on the first row of the shelf in the first column and Sliced Green Olives exist in the second column.
                This also means that the second row is completely empty.
                This also means that the third row has Sliced Dill Pickles on the first column and Sliced Jalapeno Peppers in the second column.
                The final row is empty in the first column and has Hot Sliced Banana Peppers in the second column.
                Try your best!
