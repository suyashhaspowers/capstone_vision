                You will be given an image of an wooden shelf. This shelf is supposed to represent an inventory shelf.
                Boxes will be placed on this shelf. There can be a total of 3 boxes on the shelf. Sometimes there may be 2.
                Sometimes there be 1. Sometimes there may be none.
                Your task will be to classify the contents of the boxes of the shelf. Some Boxes are white and some are brown.
                You will do this by reading the labels on the boxes and placing them in an array to indicate its position.
                Think of the shelf as a grid system with 1 rows and 3 columns.
                Boxes on the left side of a row are in the first column.
                Boxes in the middle of the row are in the second column.
                Boxes on the right side of a row are in the third column.
                Sometimes columns can be empty.
                The following box labels exist on the boxes:
                1. Sliced Black Olives
                2. Sliced Green Olives
                3. Sliced Dill Pickles

                # ['Sliced Black Olives', None, 'Sliced Dill Pickles']
                # You only need to return the array.
                This means that Sliced Black Olives exists in the first column, the second column is empty, and  Sliced Green Olives exist in the third column.
                Another example output of your response would be:
                # [None, 'Hot Sliced Banana Peppers', None]
